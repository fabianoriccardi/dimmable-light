// The third option allows you change network frequency at runtime. This method

/**
 * This is the core class of this library, to be used to get the finest control
 * on thyristors. 
 * 
 * NOTE: Design Principle for this library: The concept of Thyristor is agnostic 
 * to controlled appliance, hence measurement unit to control them should be also
 * appliance-agnostic. However, this will lead to more abstract code,
 * an undesiderable effect especially in contextes such as Arduino,
 * oriented to be as user-friendly as possible.
 * 
 * For these reason, I decided to separate the library in 2 main level of classes: 
 * a low level one (appliance-agnostic), and a higher level one for final 
 * user (a nicer appliance-dependent wrapper, e.g. Dimmable Light).
 * 
 * About this class, the "core" of the library, the name of the method 
 * to control a dimmer is setDelay(..) and not, for example, setPower(..),
 * setBrightness(..),... This gives a precise idea of what's
 * happening in electrical world, that is controlling the activation time
 * of the thyristor.
 * Secondly, the measurement unit is expressed in microsecond, 
 * allowing the finest and feasible control reachable with old and cheap
 * MCUs such as Arduino Uno (often still exceeding the real need).
