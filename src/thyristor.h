/**
 * This is the core class of this library, that provides the finest control on thyristors.
 *
 * NOTE: Design Principle for this library: There are 2 main abstraction levels: the first one,
 * represented by Thyristor class, is agnostic about the controlled load (it doesn't assume a lamp,
 * a heater or a motor). The second one provides a simpler and more concrete interface, presenting
 * simplified APIs to the user as expected by an Arduino library, and it is exemplified by
 * DimmableLight class.
 * Now, I'm aware that this is positive because it allows to write very
 * readable code IF the appliance is a light, but it is limiting and weird if the user is going to
 * use another appliance.
 *
 * About this class, the "core" of the library, the name of the method to control a dimmer is
 * setDelay(..) and not, for example, setPower(..), setBrightness(..), ... This gives a precise idea
 * of what's happening at electrical level, that is controlling the activation time of the
 * thyristor. Secondly, the measurement unit is expressed in microseconds, allowing the finest and
 * feasible control reachable with almost any MCU avaialble on the market (including Arduino UNO
 * based on ATmega328p).
